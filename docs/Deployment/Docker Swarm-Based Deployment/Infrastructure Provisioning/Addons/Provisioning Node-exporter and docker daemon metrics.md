   ansible-playbook -v deploy-node-exporter-docker-metrics.yaml -i inventory.yaml --connect=local
   ```
   Check the status of each node exporter
   ```anisble
   ansible nodes-with-exporter -i inventory.yaml --become -m script -aÂ  "files/node-exporter-manager.sh -a status" --connect=local 
   ```
